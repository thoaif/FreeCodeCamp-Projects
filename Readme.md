# FreeCodeCamp.org Projects
This is place where I keep some of the projects I do for FreeCodeCamp.org

Other projects I made FreeCodeCamp can be found at [codepen](https://codepen.io/Thoaif). Note that some of the pens with React does not work anymore.

You can also view my [FreeCodeCamp Portfoli](https://www.freecodecamp.org/thoaif).
